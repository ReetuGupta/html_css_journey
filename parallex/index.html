            <div class="bg bg1" id="biking">
                <h2 class="sub-heading left">MOUNTAIN BIKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="description">Mountain biking is a fun and thrilling outdoor activity that involves riding bikes on
                rough and uneven trails. These trails can have steep hills, sharp turns, rocks, and tree roots, making
                the ride exciting and challenging. Riders need good balance, strong control, and quick reflexes to
                handle these tough paths. The feeling of racing down a hill, jumping over small obstacles, and exploring
                new places adds to the adventure. Mountain biking is not just about speed; it’s also about enjoying
                nature and discovering beautiful landscapes like forests, mountains, and open fields.
                <br><br>

                Apart from the excitement, mountain biking offers many health benefits. It’s a great way to improve
                heart health, build strong muscles, and boost stamina. Riding on different terrains helps improve
                coordination and balance. It’s also good for mental health because spending time in nature reduces
                stress and makes you feel relaxed and refreshed. Mountain biking can be enjoyed alone for some peaceful
                time or with friends and family for fun group adventures. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced
                rider, mountain biking has something to offer for everyone. It’s a perfect way to combine fitness,
                adventure, and the joy of being outdoors.

            <div class="bg bg2" id="ice_climbling">
                <h2 class="sub-heading right">ICE CLIMBING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="description">Ice climbing is an adventurous and challenging outdoor activity where climbers ascend
                frozen waterfalls, icy cliffs, and steep ice-covered rocks. Using special equipment like ice axes,
                crampons (spiked attachments for boots), ropes, and helmets, climbers carefully make their way up
                slippery, vertical ice surfaces. It requires strength, balance, and focus to handle the cold conditions
                and tricky terrain. The thrill of reaching the top, surrounded by stunning icy landscapes, makes ice
                climbing an unforgettable experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Besides the excitement, ice climbing offers great physical and mental benefits. It helps build muscle
                strength, improves endurance, and enhances coordination. Climbing in cold environments also teaches
                patience, problem-solving, and resilience. Mentally, it sharpens focus and reduces stress as climbers
                concentrate fully on each move. Ice climbing can be enjoyed by both beginners and experienced climbers,
                with guided tours available for those new to the sport. Whether you’re scaling frozen waterfalls or icy
                mountain faces, ice climbing is a perfect way to combine adventure, fitness, and the beauty of winter
                landscapes.

            <div class="bg bg3" id="paragliding">
                <h2 class="sub-heading left">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="description">Paragliding is an exciting outdoor adventure sport where people fly through the sky
                using a lightweight, parachute-like wing called a paraglider. After running down a slope or off a hill,
                the paraglider catches the wind, lifting the pilot into the air. With the help of harnesses and control
                lines, pilots can steer and glide smoothly, enjoying breathtaking views from high above. The feeling of
                soaring like a bird, with the wind in your face and the world below, makes paragliding a thrilling and
                unforgettable experience.
                <br>
                <br>
                Besides the thrill, paragliding offers several benefits. It’s a great way to relieve stress, as flying
                through open skies creates a sense of freedom and peace. It also improves focus, coordination, and
                decision-making skills as pilots control their movements while adjusting to wind conditions. Paragliding
                doesn’t require much physical strength, making it accessible to many people, including beginners who can
                fly tandem with an instructor. Whether you’re gliding over mountains, coastlines, or wide-open fields,
                paragliding is a perfect mix of adventure, relaxation, and the joy of flying.

            <div class="bg bg4" id="canyoning">
                <h2 class="sub-heading right">CANYONING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="description">Canyoning is an adventurous outdoor activity that involves exploring canyons using
                various techniques like walking, climbing, jumping, abseiling (rappelling), and swimming. Canyons are
                often formed by rivers cutting through rock, creating beautiful landscapes with waterfalls, natural
                slides, and deep pools. Canyoning takes you through narrow passages, down steep cliffs, and into
                refreshing water, making it an exciting mix of adventure and nature exploration.
                <br>
                <br>
                Besides the thrill, canyoning offers great physical and mental benefits. It helps build strength,
                improve balance, and boost endurance as you navigate different terrains. It also develops
                problem-solving skills and teamwork, especially when done in groups. The activity allows you to connect
                with nature, reduce stress, and enjoy breathtaking views of hidden waterfalls, crystal-clear pools, and
                rugged rock formations. Whether you're a beginner exploring easy routes or an experienced adventurer
                tackling challenging canyons, canyoning is a perfect way to experience the wild, stay active, and have
                fun.

            <div class="bg bg5" id="rock_climbing">
                <h2 class="sub-heading left">ROCK CLIMBING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="description">Rock climbing is an exciting and challenging outdoor activity where climbers use
                their hands, feet, and special gear to climb up natural rock formations or artificial climbing walls. It
                requires strength, balance, and problem-solving skills to find the best routes and grips. Climbers use
                safety equipment like ropes, harnesses, carabiners, and climbing shoes to stay secure while scaling
                cliffs or boulders. The thrill of reaching the top and enjoying stunning views makes rock climbing a
                rewarding adventure.
                <br><br>
                Besides the excitement, rock climbing offers many physical and mental benefits. It helps build muscle
                strength, improve flexibility, and boost endurance. Mentally, it enhances focus, determination, and
                problem-solving skills as climbers plan their moves carefully. Climbing also reduces stress and boosts
                confidence as you overcome challenges. Whether you’re climbing indoors, on outdoor cliffs, or bouldering
                without ropes on shorter routes, rock climbing is a fun way to stay active, connect with nature, and
                experience the joy of reaching new heights.

            <div class="bg bg6" id="trekking">
                <h2 class="sub-heading right">TREKKING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="description">Trekking is an adventurous outdoor activity that involves walking long distances
                through natural landscapes like mountains, forests, and valleys. It’s a great way to explore beautiful
                sceneries, enjoy fresh air, and connect with nature. Treks can vary from easy, short trails to
                challenging routes that take several days to complete. Along the way, trekkers experience breathtaking
